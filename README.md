# Gene Expression Datasets

This repository is a collection of published gene expression datasets, generated using, mainly and classically, [microarray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray) and [RNA-Seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq) studies. These datasets are used for group projects on gene expression data analysis at [AUC](https://www.aucegypt.edu/home).

## Datasets
The following table list the different datasets included in this repository sorted somehow according to the complexity (number of conditions) of the dataset:
