# Gene Expression Datasets

This repository is a collection of published gene expression datasets, generated using, mainly and classicially, [microarray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray) and [RNA-Seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq) studies. We use these datasets for group projects on gene expression data analysis at [AUC](https://www.aucegypt.edu/home).
